    <h2>History:</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Portuguese invaded Goa in 1510, defeating the Bijapur Sultanate. The Portuguese rule lasted for about 450 years, and heavily influenced Goan culture, cuisine, and architecture. In 1961, India took control over Goa after a 36-hour battle and integrated it into India.</i>
    <h2>Location:</h2>
    <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goa is a state on the southwestern coast of India within the Konkan region, geographically separated from the Deccan highlands by the Western Ghats.It is bound by the Indian states of Maharashtra to the north, and Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea in the west. It is India's smallest state by area and fourth-smallest by population. Goa has the highest GDP per capita among all Indian states,two and a half times as high as the GDP per capita of the country as a whole.The Eleventh Finance Commission of India named Goa the best-placed state because of its infrastructure, and India's National Commission on Population rated it as having the best quality of life in India (based on the commission's "12 Indicators").[8] It is the third-highest ranking among Indian states in the human development index.</p>

        <p>Panaji is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is its largest city. The historic city of Margão in Goa still exhibits the cultural influence of the Portuguese, who first voyaged to the subcontinent in the early 16th century as merchants, and conquered it soon thereafter, whereupon Goa became an overseas territory of the Portuguese Empire, part of what was then known as Portuguese India, and remained as such for about 456 years until it was annexed by India in 1961.Goa's official language, which is spoken by a majority of its inhabitants, is Konkani.</p> 
         
        </p>  Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year because of its white-sand beaches, active nightlife, places of worship, and World Heritage-listed architecture. It also has rich flora and fauna because it lies very close to the North Western Ghats rainforests, one of the rare biodiversity hotspots of the world.</p>
    <h2>Facts:</h2>
    <i>
        <ul>
            <li>When people think of Goa, they're probably thinking about long, sandy beaches, but much of the state is also covered by forest. Goa is India's tropical paradise.

                Around 20% of the land in Goa falls into the beautiful Western Ghats of India, a vast mountain range and a treasure house of biodiversity.</li><br>
                <li>The state has fulfilled popular demand, with close to 7,000 bars across the state to choose from – and plenty of cheap alcohol. North Goa is generally more lively, although South Goa has its fair share of beach parties too.</li><br>
                <li>Covering an area of 1,429 square miles, it's only slightly bigger than Devon but has a coastline that stretches for 99 miles.Goa is one of India's wealthiest states, largely thanks to its booming tourist industry. 

                    This beautiful state has also been ranked as the best place in terms of infrastructure and living standards.</li><br>
                <li>This is the only place in India where you can pay a motorcyclist for a lift, without worrying about riding off with a complete stranger!

                    Goa is full of motorcycle taxis and riders, known as pilots, and they're known as the state's most cost-effective form of transport.
