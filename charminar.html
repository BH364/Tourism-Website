    <h2>History:</h2>
    <i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charminar was built by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591. It is said that this square shaped structure with four pillars and intricate carvings was built in honour of his wife, Bhagmati. However, the actual reason behind building Charminar is still not clear.</p>
    </i>  <h2>Location:</h2>
    <i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact Charminar address is: Pattergatti Road, Charminar, Hyderabad, Telangana - 500082</p>
<p>The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi River.To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to the southwest lies the richly ornamented granite Makkah Masjid.It is listed as an archaeological and architectural treasure on the official list of monuments prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India.The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words chār and minar or meenar, translating to "Four Pillars"; the eponymous towers are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches</p>

    <h2>Facts:</h2>
    <i><ul>
<li>While a few believe that Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah constructed Charminar in the memory of his queen Bhagmati, there’s another theory that is widely accepted. According to this theory, the massive structure was built to commemorate the end of the plague epidemic. Looking at his city in distress, the ruler had prayed that he would build a mosque if and when the plague menace ends.</li><br>
<li>Did you know that there’s a secret tunnel within the monument but no one knows where it is located? The underground tunnel is said to be a secret escape route that enabled the royal family to get away in case of a siege. It connects the Charminar with the Golconda Fort, situated in the western part of Hyderabad.</li><br>
<li>If you look closely at one of the arches on the eastern side of the Charminar, you would find a cat’s head carved in it. As mentioned earlier, the mosque was built to mark the end of plague. Since, plague is spread by infected rats and cats kill rats, the latter was included in the architecture to represent its role in eradicating the disease.

</li><br>
<li>Charminar is considered to be the centre of Hyderabad city; and this belief is not without any reason. The city was planned on a grid iron-pattern, with the iconic Charminar as the focal point. The design had two roads running east-west and north-south, which makes the structure the centre of the city.</li><br>
<li>The historical age of this monument is more than 450 years, which makes Charminar one of the oldest monuments in India. Yet this monument is still standing tall in all its glory; all hail to those centuries old craftsmanship.</li></ul>
